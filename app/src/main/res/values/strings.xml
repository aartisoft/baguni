    <string name="NUMBERS_INTRO_TITLE">How to say numbers in Korean</string>
    <string name="NUMBERS_INTRO">"Many Korean learners think Korean numbers are really difficult.
Because there are two systems of Korean numbers(Sino-Korean number / Native-Korean number) and you should use each number system depending on what the number is used for.
Therefore whenever students say numbers, they are confused about which system of number to use.

In general, each number system is used in the following situations:

1.Sino-Korean number: Number itself
2.Native-Korean number: Counting numbers

But when you learn Korean numbers, you can see that this rule is not always correct.
(For example, why the hour is Native-Korean number but the minute is Sino-Korean number?)

So I suggest to students
'Just listen and follow the correct number a lot. Then you will feel something strange right before you try to use the wrong number.'

This lesson is designed to learn Sino-Korean number and Native-Korean number
as well as to practice the numbers repeatedly in different situations.

Let's practice until '일시 오분' and '십살' seem strange!"</string>

    <string name="SL_00_TITLE">Start of learning Korean</string>

    <string name="SL_01_TITLE">Conjugation</string>
    <string name="SL_01_CONTENTS">"All Korean verbs and adjectives have a base form.
It means things that end with '~다', such as '먹다 (to eat)', '가다 (to go)' and '사다 (to buy)'.

You'll use base forms when looking for a word on dictionary, but you should change the base form to the form that you want to use when talking or writing.
For example, '먹다 (to eat)' changes as followed.

- 먹다 (to eat) : base form
- 먹어요 (I eat)
- 먹으면 (if I eat)
- 먹어서 (because I eat)
- 먹고 (after I eat)

For most of the words base forms you only need to change ""다"" to other forms.
But sometimes there are irregular words that change parts that are not '다' as well.
For example...

- 듣다 (to listen) : base form
- 들어요 (I listen)
- 들으면 (If I listen)
- 들어서(because I listen)
- 듣고(after I listen)

Many students think that irregular words are difficult, but you don't need to worry about that.
Because most of irregular forms are for easier pronunciation.
In the example above, you can pronounce easier by changing irregularly to '들어요[드러요]' instead of '듣어요[드더요]'.
Therefore, if you use it several times through speaking practice, you will naturally be able to remember irregular words."</string>

    <string name="SL_02_TITLE">Numbers</string>

    <string name="SL_03_TITLE">Conjugation</string>
    <string name="SL_03_CONTENTS">"The first conjugation you learn is the '아요/어요' form.
Let's call it '아/어요' for short.
'아/어요' is not too formal and can be polite enough.
Therefore, it is most often used in everyday conversations.

There are three rules for converting the base form to '아/어요'.
Let's take a look with an example.(You don't need to know the meaning of the words
in the example right now. Let's focus on the process of changing the base form into '아/어요'.)

1.

하다 -> 해요
: The base form of a verb or adjective ending with '~하다' is simply converted to '해요'.

ex)
공부하다 -> 공부해요
운동하다 -> 운동해요
좋아하다 -> 좋아해요

2.

When there is a vowel 'ㅏ' or 'ㅗ' -> 아요
: In the base form, you should see the letter right before the '다'.
If the letter has a vowel 'ㅏ' or 'ㅗ', this word should be added with '아요'.
Let's take a look the word '가다'.
The previous letter of '다' is '가' and '가' has a vowel 'ㅏ'.
Therefore, the word '가다' is conjugated to '가' + '아요' = '가아요',
and '가아요' can be simplified to '가요'.

ex)
'오다' -> '오' + '아요' = '오아요' -> '와요'
'만나다' -> '만나' + '아요' = '만나아요' -> '만나요'
'살다' -> '살' + '아요' -> '살아요'

3.

Everything except 1 and 2 -> 어요
: Let's look at the word '먹다.
This word doesn't end with '하다'.
And since the vowels of the '먹' is 'ㅓ', it's not type 2 as well.
Therefore, this word is type 3 and you should add '어요'.

ex)
'먹다' -> '먹' + '어요' = '먹어요'
'배우다' -> '배우' + '어요' = '배우어요' -> '배워요'
'읽다' -> '읽' + '어요' = '읽어요'

So far, we have looked at the '아/어요' and let's make a promise with me now.
Just think about this rule until Lesson 10 and forget about this.
Actually there are only a few Koreans who know this rule.
When you learn new verbs or adjectives just take a look '아/어요' as well.
And just say '아요' or '어요' as it is pronounced comfortably. It might be correct.

I'm going to say one more interesting thing and finish this lesson.
The '아/어요' is so powerful that it can have a variety meanings depending on how you speak or what's the situation.

For example, let's see the word '먹어요'.
a. '먹어요.' (You eat)
b. '먹어요?' (Do you eat?)
c. '먹어요!!' (You must to eat!)
There are many other meanings, but let's just remember two things of 'a' and 'b'."</string>

    <string name="SL_04_TITLE">Particles</string>
    <string name="SL_04_CONTENTS">"Students who use a language without particles have a lot of difficulty with particles in Korean.
The most difficult are '은/는', '이/가' and '을/를'.
We'll learn each particle later and I'm going to explain why we use the particles in this lesson.

There are two sentences in English.

1. I eat lion.
2. Lion eat I. (Of course,'The lion eats me' is correct but ignore it now)

The subject of sentence 1 is 'I' and the object is 'lion'.
However, the subject of sentence 2 is 'lion' and the object is 'I'.
In other words, depending on the position of the word, the subject and the object are determined and the meaning of sentence becomes completely different.

Now let's look at the Korean sentence using particles.

1. 나는 사자를 먹어요
2. 사자를 나는 먹어요

'나' meaning 'I' is added subject particle '는'
and '사자' meaning 'lion' is added object particle '를'.
When you use particles, the role of the word is fixed.
So the sentence always has the same meaning no matter where the word is.
Therefore, sentence 1 and 2 is totally same meaning as 'I eat lion'.

This is the difference between a language that uses particles and a language that does not.
But it's not a good idea to change the position of words all the time.
Korean language generally uses the order of 'subject-object-predicate',
so it would be better to follow this order."</string>

    <string name="SL_05_TITLE">Speaking Naturally</string>
    <string name="SL_05_CONTENTS">"There are 2 basic tips to make your pronunciation better.

1.

 The consonant (not batchim) 'ㅇ' is a kind of an empty place because it has no sound.
Therefore, when there is a batchim before the consonant 'ㅇ', you can put this batchim into the place of the consonant 'ㅇ' for reading naturally.
For example, '사람이에요' has a batchim 'ㅁ' in the letter '람' and the next letter of '이' has a consonant 'ㅇ' that is an empty place.
So it is good to read [사라미에요].

2.

 batchim 'ㅎ' makes following consonants stronger.
If the consonants 'ㄱ', 'ㄷ', 'ㅈ' comes after batchim 'ㅎ', they sound each 'ㅋ', 'ㅌ', 'ㅊ'.

ex)
- '좋다' -> [조타]
- '놓고' -> [노코]
- '많지' -> [만치]

    <string name="SL_06_TITLE">Confusing expression</string>
    <string name="SL_06_CONTENTS">"1. 5시에 운동을 해요.
2. 5시에서 운동을 해요.

Which one is correct?

1.

Use '에' after the noun to indicate the time.

ex)
- 5시에 운동을 해요.
- 아침에 학교를 가요.
- 저녁에 약속이 있어요.

2.

Use '에서' after the noun to indicate the place.

ex)
- 학교에서 한국어를 공부해요.
- 집에서 TV를 봐요.
- 식당에서 밥을 먹어요.

Isn't it too easy? Now, let's learn a little bit more.

2-1.

In a sentence with a verb indicating existence (있다/없다)
and a verb indicating movement (가다/오다/도착하다/다니다...),
we use '에' after the noun indicating the place.

ex)
- 서점에 책이 있어요.
- 밖에 사람이 없어요.
- 병원에 가요.
- 어제 한국에 도착했어요.
- 한국어 학교에 다녀요.

In other words, we unconditionally use '에' after the noun that indicating the time,
and we basically use ""에서"" after the noun that indicates the place.
but sometimes use '에' after the noun that indicating the place according to verb of its sentence.
"</string>

    <string name="SL_07_TITLE">Speaking Naturally</string>
    <string name="SL_07_CONTENTS">"How do you say the words below in Korean?

- Bibimbap restaurant
- Spaghetti restaurant
- tteokbokki restaurant

- 비빔밥 식당
- 스파게티 식당
- 떡볶이 식당

Is that right?

You can say '식당' when you talk about a restaurant.
But native speakers often say the 'food' + '집'(house).
So the restaurants above could be

- 비빔밥집
- 스파게티집
- 떡볶이집

In this way, it can be much more natural.
Well, how can we say Korean restaurant?
Korean food is called '한국 음식' and is called '한식' shortly.
Therefore, you can say '한식집' or '한식당'. "</string>

    <string name="SL_08_TITLE">Conjugation</string>
    <string name="SL_08_CONTENTS">"1.

As we learned in previous lesson, '아서/어서' is used as a reason or cause.

ex)
- 만나서 반가워요. ('만나다' -> '만나서')
- 저거는 50% 세일이어서 5,000원이에요. ('이다' -> '이어서')
- 겨울이어서 날씨가 추워요. ('이다' -> '이어서')

'이다 -> 이어서' is better to say '이라서' in the conversation.
So in the real conversation the above are ...

- 저거는 50% 세일이라서 5,000원이에요.
- 겨울이라서 날씨가 추워요.

2.

We also use '아서/어서' to refer to the relationship between time.
At this time, there must be a close connection between what happened before and what happened afterwards.

ex)
- 한국에 가서 한국어를 배워요.
- 친구를 만나서 얘기해요.
- 식당에 가서 밥을 먹어요.

    <string name="SL_09_TITLE">Newly-coined word</string>
    <string name="SL_09_CONTENTS">"'Newly-coined word' is a new word made popular by young people.
Some people say it's better not to use it because it's not a standard language.
But I think it is helpful to foreigners to make learning korean more fun.
However, it is recommended not to use it in formal situations.

Well, let's look at some of the most common new words used in 2019.

1. 인플루언서

: Korean pronunciation of English 'influencer'.
It means the people who have a large number of followers In social media and influence the public.

2. 편스토랑

: A combination of '편의점 (convenience store)' and '레스토랑 (restaurant)'.
It means a convenience store where you can have a good meal like a restaurant.

3. 소떡소떡

: It's a snack that '소시지 (sausage)' and '떡 (rice cake)' are alternately sticked and baked.
That's why it is called '소떡소떡'.

4. 스포

: It's from English 'spoiler'. The act of telling others about the contents of a movie in advance.

5. 꾸안꾸

: It is made up of shortened '꾸민 듯 안 꾸민 듯 (like not put makeup)'.
It means that you put on makeup naturally, as if you did not do makeup."

    <string name="SL_10_TITLE">Simple Chinese Character1</string>
    <string name="SL_10_CONTENTS">
"You might wonder why there are Chinese character lesson.
Since Korea used Chinese characters in the past, there are lots of words made from Chinese characters.

Usually formal writing uses the words from Chinese character.
Therefore, if you don't know the words from Chinese character, you could be overwhelmed because there are too many unknown words when you start reading Korean articles.

However, because each Chinese character has its own meaning, learning very easy Chinese characters can help you to understand the meaning of words.
Therefore, let's pick only very easy Chinese characters and learn together.

The first Chinese character we will learn is '人'(사람 인).
This Chinese character has the meaning of '사람'(people) and the sound of '인'.
The shape of this letter is also very interesting.
It is a letter made of people walking as shown in the picture of this lesson.
Therefore, if there is a letter '인' in Korean word, we can guess that it is related to 'people'.

ex)
- 한국인 : Korean
- 인간 : human
- 인구 : population
- 인격 : personality

    <string name="SL_11_CONTENTS">
        "1. 저는 스키를 좋아요.
2. 저는 스키를 좋아해요.

Which one is correct?

1.

Use '좋아요' after the Subject(which is able to use with '이/가') and it's base form is '좋다'(good).
So it means the 'Subject' is good.

ex)
- 저는 스키가 좋아요.
- 저는 치킨이 좋아요.
- 오늘은 날씨가 좋아요.

Use '좋아해요' after the Object(which is able to use with '을/를') and it's base form is '좋아하다'(like).
So it means the 'Subject' likes 'Object'.

ex)
- 저는 스키를 좋아해요.
- 저는 치킨을 좋아해요.
- 눈이 오는 날씨를 좋아해요.

Sometimes we omit '은/는' and '이/가' in real conversation.
In this case, never be confused, you just remember it means 'good' or 'like'."

1.

1) 시간이 없어서 빨리 가세요.
2) 시간이 없으니까 빨리 가세요.

Which one is correct?

'아/어서' is not allowed in 'order' or 'request' statements.
Therefore, sentence 1)  is a weird sentence.
Likewise, instead of
'이 식당은 비빔밥이 맛있어서 비빔밥 먹으세요',
'이 식당은 비빔밥이 맛있으니까 비빔밥 먹으세요' is the correct expression.


2.

1) 한국에 살았어서 한국어를 잘해요.
2) 한국에 살았으니까 한국어를 잘해요.

Which one is correct?

'으니까' is not available for past tense.
Therefore, sentence 1)  is correct.


3.

1) 만나서 반가워요.
2) 만났으니까 반가워요.

Which one is correct?

Everyone can easily see that 1) is the right sentence.
But you may not know why.
'으니까' cannot be used in adjectives expressing emotions.
For example, '반갑다', '고맙다', '미안하다'.


SUMMARY)
There are three rules, but you don't have to remember them all.
Usually, you can use '아/어서' and use '으니까' only when expressing 'order' or 'request'.

It's easy to know '여기' and '저기', but there are also a word '거기' in Korean.
In English, '저기' and '거기' are translated as 'there'. What is the difference?

'여기': a place close to the speaker

- 여기로 오세요. : Come here.
- 여기 앉으세요. : Sit down here.

'저기': a place far away from both the speaker and the listener.

ex)
- 저기에 뭐가 있어요? : What is there?
- 저기로 가요 : Let's go there.

'거기': A place close to the listener.
In other words, the speaker and the listener are not in the same place and are talking about the 'there(거기)' where the listener is.

- 거기에 어떻게 가요? : How can I get there?


2.

In addition, there is one more thing to know about '거기'.
We use '거기' when we talk about a place that was once mentioned during a conversation.

ex)
- 저기에 가 보세요. 거기에 물이 있어요. : Go over there. There's some water.
- 저기에서 기다리세요. 데니 씨가 거기로 갈 거예요. : Wait over there. Denny will be there.
